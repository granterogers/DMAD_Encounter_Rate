A Series of R Scripts to Calculate the Encounter Rates
of TT Dolphins within the MNE Survey Area over each Season

** REQUIREMENTS **

1) DMAD Master Data Set:

\DATA\MONTENEGRO MASTER DATA SET.xls

2) Pythagoras Master Data Set:

\DATA\PYTHAGORAS_MNE.xls

**Static Inputs - No need to modify unless desired:

3) A gridded shapefile covering the Entire Survey area between the shore and the
farthest boat survey extent (or larger)

Each Cell requires a weighting factor which described the fraction of the grid cell that overlays land.

\DATA\Full_Survey_Area_Grid_With_Weight.gpkg 

4) A shapefile of the land station survey areas whose dimensions are determined by the angular limits of the land station site and the farthest sighting (boat or dolphin) recorded.

All filenames must match exactly!

** TO RUN **

A recent copy of R-Studio @ https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Simply execute each R Script in the order listed by filename:

1 - Calculate Boat Effort.R
2 - Calculate Land Effort.R
3 - Create Combined Grid Effort.R
4 - Extract Boat Sightings.R
5 - Extract Land Sightings.R
6 - Create Combined Grid Sightings.R
7 - Calculate Encounter Rates.R

Outputs of each Script are sent to the "OUT" directory in the form of Shapefile and CSV Files and can be easily imported into GIS Software for Map Creation.

The Final Encounter Rate Script needs each previous script to be ran beforehand!

Some scripts may take a while to load libraries and finish execution.

Enjoy :)

NOTE: If you wish to run the whole script setup in one go, you can run the following code in a file saved in the 'R' directory:

setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

source("1 - Calculate Boat Effort.R")
rm(list = ls())
source("2 - Calculate Land Effort.R")
rm(list = ls())
source("3 - Create Combined Grid Effort.R")
rm(list = ls())
source("4 - Extract Boat Sightings.R")
rm(list = ls())
source("5 - Extract Land Sightings.R")
rm(list = ls())
source("6 - Create Combined Grid Sightings.R")
rm(list = ls())
source("7 - Calculate Encounter Rates.R")
